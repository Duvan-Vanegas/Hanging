**Hangman** is a classic game where the player attempts to guess a secret word letter by letter. This project is developed using **React** and **JavaScript**.

## Project Description

This Hangman game is a simple implementation that allows users to guess a secret word. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word, and with each wrong guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn. The goal is to guess the entire word before the hangman drawing is completed.

## Features

- Interactive interface developed with React.
- Tracks the progress of the guessed word.
- Counter for remaining attempts.
- Visual representation of the hangman figure.
- Randomly generated words for each game session.
